		Recording attendance in classroom with strength of 70-80 students using traditional manual methods becomes a bickering task. Our system “WEB WARDEN” reduces the hassle for the teachers and helps them carry out the task in order. Through this project we aim to reduce the hassle of manual attendance taking methods and provide a easy solution to record attendance, view attendance and create a defaulters list for the same. Through this website students can also view their attendance and see in which subject they lack attendance. Students can also view notes uploaded by the teacher on this website. Due to this the student need not view various different sites to view the study material rather they can find everything at a single place. Thus the name “WEB WARDEN”. WEB WARDEN as the name suggests will truly act as a warden to keep a watch on the students and help them with their academics. This platform acts as a bridge between teachers and students to be informed about the activities happening inside the classroom.
